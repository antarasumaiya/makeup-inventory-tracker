Makeup Inventory Tracker

Summary (singular purpose): I want to build a web-based makeup inventory tracker system for my Facebook page Ella’s Closet so that my moderators and I can keep track of my product stock, manage the products, keep a sales tracking, search and filter products, generate reports and manage product suppliers. At this moment, I am managing the inventory through excel sheets and it’s becoming quite complex to manage all the operations with it. Alos, there is less scope of development if I want to extend my services and operations. So, I want to have an Inventory Tracking System where I can manage multiple operations in one place. 

 

Detailed description: The web-based application will be developed for managing the inventory of my makeup business using JavaScript. It will be an internal application not available for public usage. The application will provide a user-friendly interface for tracking products, managing stock levels, and generating reports. The business owner and employees will be the only users of this web-application. The key features will include the following things: 

1. User Authentication: User Registration, user login, access control 

2. Product Management: Add, edit, or delete makeup products, including details such as name, product category, price, quantity, brand, supplier name and image. 

3. Inventory Dashboard: It will display current inventory levels with a visual overview. For Example: Pie Charts. 

4. Stock Monitoring: Providing alerts for low stock items, keeping real-time stock updates. 

5. Search and Filter: Easily search for products by name, filter products by categories, prices, brands etc. 

6. Sales Tracking: Record sales transactions and automatically update inventory levels, providing insights into best-selling products. 

7. Order and Invoice Generation: Users will create, place orders and generate invoices. 

8. Reporting: Generate reports on inventory status and sales trends 

This web-application will be built using JavaScript for the front end, possibly utilizing frameworks like React or Vue.js for a responsive and interactive user experience. Node.js will be used for the back end to handle data storage and business logic, with a database like MongoDB for persistent data management.
